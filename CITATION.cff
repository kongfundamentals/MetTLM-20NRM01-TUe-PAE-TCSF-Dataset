abstract: >-
  The phantom array effect (PAE) has been extensively
  studied, yet existing data remain insufficiently
  consistent to enable accurate predictions of its
  visibility. A key step toward developing a reliable
  visibility measure is the characterization of the temporal
  contrast sensitivity function. This software package
  provides both the curated datasets and the code used to
  generate the visualizations presented in the paper
  "Measuring the Temporal Contrast Sensitivity Function of
  the Phantom Array Effect." One of its main features is a
  comprehensive compilation of data extracted from the
  literature, enabling detailed visualization and comparison
  of PAE visibility across studies.
